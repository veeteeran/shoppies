# Overview for The Shoppies:trophy:

## What is this project?

This webpage will allow users to search for movie titles and add them to a list of nominees for The Shoppies.

## How does it work?

The user can type the title of a movie into the search bar. The results box shows a list of movies that match the text in the search bar. Users can add titles to the nominees list by clicking the nominate button or remove from the nominees list clicking the remove button. Once five nominees are chosen a message appears alert the user of their choices.
